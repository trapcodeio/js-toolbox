# Trapcode's Toolbox

Well Documented Functions we find ourselves reinventing every-time.

Written in Typescript for different environments and frameworks but for now we will focus on functions required by

- Nodejs related functions
- Browsers related functions

All shipped in modules and strictly typed.
